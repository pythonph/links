## Python 2.x vs. Python 3.x
- Note: [Python 2.7 will not be maintained starting on January 1, 2020](https://pythonclock.org/). If you are a beginner looking to learn Python, we highly recommend learning Python 3. If you need to know Python 2, we recommend learning Python 3 first *then* learning the difference between both versions. It would be easier *and* you'll still be able to apply what you've learned, going forward.
